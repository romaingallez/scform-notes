# SCForm Notes

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/99XCDj?referralCode=-nFAKR)

## Project Purpose

SCForm Notes is a helper application designed to extract and manage grade information from GALIA, a learning management system/ERP used by educational institutions. This tool addresses specific limitations of GALIA, which does not provide:

- A way to download or export grades
- Calculation of a global GPA (Grade Point Average)

This application allows students to efficiently access, track, and analyze their academic performance data outside of GALIA's native interface.

[Version fran√ßaise](README.fr.md)

A web application built with Go (Fiber) and modern frontend technologies for managing and processing form data. The application uses HTMX for dynamic interactions and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## üöÄ Features

- Modern web interface with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
- Server-side rendering with Go templates
- Dynamic UI updates using HTMX
- Form data processing and management
- Asset management system
- Environment configuration support
- Live reload development with Air

## üõ† Tech Stack

### Backend
- Go (Fiber web framework)
- HTML Templates
- Environment configuration with godotenv
- Air (Live reload)

### Frontend
- HTMX for dynamic interactions
- Hyperscript for enhanced interactivity
- Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI components
- Webpack for asset bundling

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Go 1.x
- Node.js and pnpm
- Air (Go live reload tool)
- Environment variables (copy from .env.example)

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the environment configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Build the frontend assets:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Using standard Go
   go run main.go

   # Using Air for live reload during development
   air
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

You can also run the application using Docker:

1. Pull the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/romaingallez/scform-notes:latest
   ```

2. Create a `.env.docker` file from the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
   ```
   
   Make sure to update the environment variables in `.env.docker` as needed.

3. Run browserless/chrome container (required for form processing):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 1337:3000 --rm --name chrome browserless/chrome
   ```

4. Run the application container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --rm --env-file .env.docker --name scform-notes ghcr.io/romaingallez/scform-notes:latest
   ```

5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Docker Compose (Alternative)

You can also use Docker Compose to run both containers:

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       image: ghcr.io/romaingallez/scform-notes:latest
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       env_file:
         - .env.docker
       depends_on:
         - chrome
     chrome:
       image: browserless/chrome
       ports:
         - "1337:3000"
   ```

2. Run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## üîß Development

### Frontend Development
- Watch for Tailwind CSS changes:
  ```bash
  pnpm run watch
  ```

### Backend Development
- The application uses Go modules for dependency management
- Main application entry point is in `main.go`
- For live reload during development, use Air:
  ```bash
  # Install Air if you haven't already
  go install github.com/cosmtrek/air@latest

  # Run the application with Air
  air
  ```
- Core logic is organized in the `internals` directory:
  - `scform/`: Form-related functionality
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `web/`: Web server and routing logic
